                <p>Maintain DME web sites and perform design tasks. Perform routine quality checks to ensure sites are

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>Web developers have two main career paths to choose from, depending on work style and level of
                    experience. I might opt for a stable, salaried position, or enjoy more autonomy as an independent
                    contractor</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>As a Web developer, I want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material,
                    provide interactivity, and be artistically pleasing to the user. In order to do this, I need to know
                    the nuances of Web design and delivery and the various tools and software applications I can use.

            <p>To be a member of the global community means to look at your responsibilities to those close to you and
                to those simply sharing the planet, because at the most fundamental level we are all connected. Being a
                member of a global community means that there is power within the community to bring voices together to
                effect change.</p>
