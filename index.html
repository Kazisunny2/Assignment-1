                <p>Web developers have two main career paths to choose from, depending on work style and level of

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>As a Web developer, I want to be able to design Web pages that can effectively display material,
                    provide interactivity, and be artistically pleasing to the user. In order to do this, I need to know
                    the nuances of Web design and delivery and the various tools and software applications I can use.
